<h1>The solution for the second part of the SIMC qualifying contest in H-Farm IS.</h1>

<h2>Required format of the solutions and answers:</h2>

<h3>Dear colleagues, I made a mistake and didn't ask you to save your group distribution in the default format.
Now I am asking you to resend your results in the following format (see description below) so I could check it using one standard validator program and one standard RWA calc program.

Name of the file(s): 2a_answer.csv, 2b_answer.csv
Delimiter: comma (,)
Each file should have 6 (six) columns.
column_names: asset, liab, m_d, m_p, ir, gn (so delete "group number example")
All unnetted deals should have gn (group number) equal to -1.
All assigned group numbers should be a non-negative integers.
Do not add unspecified symbols or data to this format (and yes, I feeling like I prompting LLM now).</h3>
